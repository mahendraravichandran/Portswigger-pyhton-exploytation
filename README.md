**Portswigger-python-exploytation**

This repository contains Python scripts created as part of my learning journey through the PortSwigger Web Security Academy. The focus is on practicing and automating different exploitation techniques, starting with SQL Injection labs and gradually covering other vulnerabilities.

**Acknowledgements**

1. A huge thanks to **Rana Khalil** for her incredible teaching and detailed notes. Following her GitHub resources and YouTube tutorials made the learning process much easier and more engaging.
2. The scripts here are slightly modified or improvised based on my own understanding and experimentation.
3. Special thanks to PortSwigger for providing high-quality, free labs and resources that enable practicing real-world web security concepts in a safe environment.

**Repository Structure**

1. SQLi/ - Scripts related to SQL Injection labs.
2. Authentication - Scripts related to authentication labs
3. More categories will be added as I progress through different vulnerabilities.
